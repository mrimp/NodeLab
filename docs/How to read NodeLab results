# How to Read NodeLab Results

NodeLab analyzes **paired ShotMarker targets and chronograph strings** to identify repeatable, distance-relevant charge nodes.  
It is designed with long-range disciplines (especially 1000-yard F-Class) in mind, where **vertical consistency and repeatability** matter as much as raw group size.

This guide explains how to interpret NodeLab’s outputs and turn them into confident shooting decisions.

## 1. What NodeLab Is Scoring

Every ranked result represents a **combined assessment of precision and velocity stability**, not just a “pretty group.”

### A. Target-Based Precision (what the target did)
- **Dispersion metrics** (mean radius / group size): overall tightness
- **Vertical vs horizontal shape**: vertical dispersion is weighted more heavily because it directly impacts elevation at distance
- **Pattern diagnostics** (if present): indicators like vertical walk, two-group behavior, or erratic dispersion that explain *how* the group was formed

### B. Chronograph Support (what the velocity did)
- Velocity SD / ES and robustness checks are used to **support or weaken confidence**
- A tight group with unstable velocity can still score well, but confidence will reflect the risk

NodeLab intentionally balances these two domains so results reflect **field-relevant performance**, not lab-only perfection.

## 2. Score vs Confidence (the two numbers that matter)

Each ranked entry has:
- **Score** – *How good this result is relative to others*
- **Confidence** – *How much the data supports that score*

Think of them this way:

| Score | Confidence | Interpretation |
|------|------------|----------------|
| High | High | Proven, repeatable node — first choice |
| High | Low | Promising but under-supported — re-test |
| Low | High | Consistently mediocre — stop chasing |
| Low | Low | Noisy or insufficient data |

A result that *wins narrowly* but has **much higher confidence** is often the smarter choice.

## 3. What a “Node” Actually Is

A node is **not** a single standout target.

A true node shows:
- Agreement across multiple targets or sessions
- Stable vertical behavior
- Reasonable velocity consistency
- Adequate shot count

If a charge looks great once but collapses when more data is added, it wasn’t a node — it was a cameo.

## 4. Shot Count and Sighters

More shots = more truth.

- **5–10 shot groups** are meaningful
- **Multiple groups** are better
- **Sighters are automatically excluded** from scoring

Sighters are allowed to exist in the dataset (because real shooting includes them), but they do not influence rankings.

Low confidence often means **low shot count**, not bad shooting.

## 5. Using the Ranking Table in Practice

### Match Ammo Selection
1. Start at the top of the ranking table
2. Prefer results with **high confidence** and no red-flag diagnostics
3. Open the drilldown and verify:
   - Vertical vs horizontal shape makes sense
   - Performance isn’t driven by a single outlier group
   - Chronograph pairing is correct and complete
