Methodology note (for nerds): NodeLab’s “Scoring Zone Probability” is inspired by the broader concept of Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ) analysis—using uncertainty and dispersion to describe an effectiveness envelope. NodeLab adapts the idea for precision rifle by comparing observed dispersion to scoring-ring geometry at distance. The UI intentionally avoids acronyms and presents results qualitatively.
