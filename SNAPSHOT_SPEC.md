# NodeLab Snapshot JSON Spec (v1.0)

This file defines the stable JSON export contract between NodeLab and companion tools
(e.g., BarrelTracker). The authoritative, full specification text is the same as the
version reviewed and approved in the design discussion.

NOTE:
This file is intentionally versioned and should only change via explicit schema
version bumps (semantic versioning).

For the complete field-by-field specification, examples, and validation checklist,
refer to the NodeLab Snapshot JSON Spec (v1.0) as approved.
